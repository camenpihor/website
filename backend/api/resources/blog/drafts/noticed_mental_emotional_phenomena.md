---

- 2 types of stress (spirally and avoidance)
- misattributing emotions to more global categories
- tiredness becoming sadness/melancholy
- melancholy = tiredness + sadness
- cyclical motivation
- fewer external distractions so a too close look at how productive I am
- days may feel different, but weeks feel the same and so time passes so quickly
- good food is a huge source of novelty right now
- conflating the large and small

So, I've now been unemployed and living in this new social reality (due to the socially
restricting external environment) for about 4 months now. This has left me with lots of time to myself, thus
creating the environment where I am almost forced to constantly be aware of how I am
doing. I think this is an experience that a lot of people might be going through and so I
thought that I would share some new noticings that I've had during it.

(I've been trying different tools in combating these things, but I wanted to leave this
post as the noticings since I'm still mostly in the noticing myself. But, if you feel like
some of these also apply to you, or you would like to talk about any of them, I would be happy to
share where I am at!)

All of these examples will be of the form:

1. [high level description of the thing that I've noticed] (medium confidence)

[lower level descriptions expanding on what I've noticed] (mostly low confidence and
speculatative)

1. Two responses to stress (spirally and avoidance)

I've been aware of my tendency to respond to stress with thought-spirals, but an
additional response (that seems obvious in retrospect) is that I sometimes just avoid the
thing I'm stressed about.

To start though, by "thought-spirals" I mean the tendency to
hyper-focus on one thing or thought with the semi-physical feeling of that thought
revolving in my head where each revolution increases my stress or anxiety.

By avoidance, I mean something that feels harder to describe since I'm just now noticing
this pattern. For me this begins as an increase in activation energy to think
about or to do the thing I'm stresses about which leads to a decision to not do it. This repeats a couple of
times and then this process becomes internalized and stream-lined such that I'll just feel
stressed, and I'll completely miss out on the part where I become aware of the the thing,
think about it, and then decide not to do it. At the end I'm just left with this _feeling_ of stress
that is not consciously attached to anything (or is almost attached to everything?), and this is pretty stagnating. The most annoying part is
that the time it takes to go from consciously making decisions of avoidance to just being left with the
feeling of stress is like an hour! And then I'm just in this trap until some seemlingly
random thing happens to break me out of it. So annoying haha.

I imagine that some people are more acutely aware of the avoidance response (not
necessarily in the same specific way as me), and it seems so obvious in retrospect that a
response to stress is avoidance, but, for me, I feel like I mostly respond to stress with
thought-spirals, but I have started to become more aware of this more insidious response.

2. Interaction between tiredness and sadess

I have found myself in a position where I have recently felt sad, felt like I resolve
it, but later in the day or week when I inevitably get tired, I start to feel
sad again! This could just be that the thing just has not been "resolved" and so I'm not
actually tired but just sad again, but I'm tempted to think another interaction is at play,
at least sometimes.

I think that being tired and being sad just _feel_ similar. So when we feel tired, we go
on this search for all things "tired", and if there was some recent sadness, that gets
gobbled up by our search and re-raised.

This one is a bit weird, and I'm still trying to grok what this interaction is and how it
happens, but I've been noticing more recently a pathway from tired to sad, and the flavors
of melancholy which is perhaps the coexistence of tiredness and sadness.

3. Upscaling emotional responses to more global causes
