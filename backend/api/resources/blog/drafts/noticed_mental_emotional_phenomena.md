---

- 2 types of stress (spirally and avoidance)
- misattributing emotions to more global categories
- tiredness becoming sadness/melancholy
- melancholy = tiredness + sadness
- cyclical motivation
- fewer external distractions so a too close look at how productive I am
- days may feel different, but weeks feel the same and so time passes so quickly
- good food is a huge source of novelty right now
- conflating the large and small

So, I've now been unemployed and living in this new social reality (due to external
events) for about 4 months now. This has left me with lots of time to myself, thus
creating the environment where I am almost forced to be constantly aware of how I am
doing. I think this is an experience that a lot of people might be going through and so I
thought that I would share some new noticings that I've had!

I've been trying different tools in combating these things, but I wanted to leave this
post as the noticings since I'm still mostly in the noticing myself! But if you feel like
some of these also apply to you, and you would like to talk about it, I would be happy to
share where I am at with attending to them.

All of these examples will be of the form:

1. [high level description of the thing that I've noticed] (medium confidence)

[lower level descriptions expanding on what I've noticed] (mostly low confidence and
speculatative)

1. Two responses to stress (spirally and avoidance)

I've been aware of my tendency to respond to stress with thought-spirals, but an
additional response (that seems obvious in retrospect) is that I sometimes just avoid the
thing I'm stressed about. For me this begins as an increase in activation energy to think
about or to do the thing which leads to a decision to not do it. This repeats a couple of
times and then this process becomes internalized and stream-lined such that I'll just feel
stressed, and I'll completely miss out on the part where I conscioulsy feel the need to do
the thing and decide not to. At the end I'm just left with this _feeling_ of stress that
is not consciously attached to anything, and this is stagnating. The most annoying part is
that the time it takes to go from consciously making decisions to just being left with the
feeling of stress is like an hour! And then I'm just in this trap until some seemlingly
random thing happens. So annoying haha.

2. Interaction between tiredness and sadess

I have found myself in a position where I recently felt sad, but then feeling like it's
been resolved, but later in the day or week when I inevitably get tired, I start to feel
sad again! This could just be that the thing just has not been "resolved" and so I'm not
actually tired but just sad again, but I'm tempted to think another interaction is at play
at least sometimes.

I think that being tired and being sad just _feel_ similar, and so we go into this
subconscious search on why we feel a certain way which just slips into this other path
(sadness) due to that feeling being perhaps a bit more valent and recent. Then, that sends
back a signal of "oh no you're just sad because of this thing".
