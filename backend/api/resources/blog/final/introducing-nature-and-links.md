Hai! I am continuing to work on long-form posts about specific topics, but I want to also
contribute some posts to a couple new series in order to accomplish some additional
goals and encourage more frequent writing. The two series are a
__Nature Journal__ and __Links__.

## Nature Journal

In this "journal" I want to perform weekly entries in which each is focusing on a
particular element of the nature found in cities. An example could be an entry on cherry
trees, where I could introduce indentification tips, their history and evolution, or
answer any questions that come to mind like "Why do they often have many brown spots on
otherwise green leaves?" or "Why do their leaves have jagged edges?", whatever I end up
thinking about as I attempt to notice cherry trees throughout the week.

With these posts I hope to continue to grow the amount of things I notice as I walk
around, encourage myself to stick with my noticing a bit more than just providing a name,
stoking curiosity, and introducing others to nature that may be around them too!

Everything has quirks, and I want to spend more time exploring what the nature around me
is saying. Cities (that I've visited in the US) tend to plant very similar green life, and
specific animals have adapted to live in our most-dense population centers, so hopefully
there will be enough overlap between the plants and animals around me versus around you.
Even if not, most things have very bizzare facts, histories, and lives and so I expect
that these short-form journal entries will be interesting in and of themselves.

So, expect to see a weekly journal entry highlighting some aspect of the nature around
where I live, and I hope that you can follow along and notice it too!

## Links

With some irregular interval I want to provide a post of links with short descriptions of things that I've read, watched, or listened to that may be interesting to other
people. I notice that I spend a lot of time seeking laughter and wonder, and I figured
that it could be nice to share some of that with others.

Thanks for reading! If any of these seem particularly interesting, or you would like to
encourage me to highlight something in the nature journal or links posts, let me
know at [camen[dot]piho[at]gmail.com](mailto:camen.rogue@gmail.com). :)
