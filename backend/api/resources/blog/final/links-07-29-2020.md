Young young John Green [gives some thoughs on "What to do with my life after college"][21]
in traditional John Green form.

During the the Triassic Period, when the continents were formed into Pangea, [there were
consistent, global floods for 2 million years in what's called the Carnian Pluvian
Episode][19]. We don't really know why, but we think that a burst a volcanic eruptions
dumped enough carbon dioxide to raise the global temprature between 5 - 18 degrees
Fahrenheit, speeding up the water cycle and causing it to rain everywhere, a lot.

Joe Hanson [explores the various colors that ice can appear][18] focusing mostly on the
bright blue of glaciers. Water weakly absorbs red/orange light, but this effect is pretty small and so most of the time it doesn't cause any
meaningful effect in its color. However, in glaciers, which are super dense and huge ice structures,
there is just so much ice that we can finally see this property, resulting in blue we see
(since a lot of the red/orange light has been absorbed).

Chameleons [affect their skin color in 3 ways][17]: (1) altering the amount of pigment visible in
their skin; (2) controlling the spacing between nano-crystals in their skin so that these
microstructures reflect light differently; and (3) having their bones reflect light in the UV spectrum. This glow is only present
in some areas of their skin and is caused by that area being super thin, enough that
the bone underneath can interact with light. Chameleons can see in UV, and it is thought
that they use this glowing for communication and species identification.

While learning about how trees get water from their roots to their leaves, I learned about
the [Marangoni effect][15] which describes the movement of two fluids due to differences in surface
tension. I found surface tension to be easily understood on the surface level (ha... ha...), but that it's
a concept that I could keep explaining to myself in different ways and "understand" it
more and more. Learning about this effect was a really good way to do that for me. I
recommend wathcing the video in Wikipedia link above to see a demonstration using soap
(low surface tension) and water (high surface tension) with the pepper flakes in the water
used to show how the fluid moves.

Another interesting thing that I came across while researching water transport in trees,
was that [we (meaning humans) have built a synthetic tree][16]! There's been a ton of
debate on if one of the proposed mechanisms of water transport in trees could work, and so
a group of researchers decided to just build one to find out. The tree isn't huge, but I found this a
poignant example of a theoretical discussion getting dominated by just doing it, and I
really like those. There's still some open discussion around water transport in trees as this doesn't verify
that trees actually use this exact mechanism, but it sheds some light on what are some valid
theories. If you want to read the paper, feel free to shoot me an email! Sorry that the link above
is behind a paywall, I couldn't find a version of the paper that isn't...

Air pressure is another idea that is easy for me to hear and feel like I understand, but
that I find hard to apply to other things (implying that there is some deep way
that it hasn't clicked). [In this video, Joe Hanson, talks about the history of air
pressure through the initial question of, "why doesn't the atmosphere crush us?"][20]. The
answer is simple in that everything about us just pushes back against that pressure -- our
bones, the liquid in our cells, our lungs -- but groking this is more of a journey for me.

So I am getting really into birds, and [this is a live feed of a couple bird feeders at
Sapsucker Woods in New York][13]. A little weird, but I found it a really nice way to get
lots of repitition at identifiying some more common birds!

Continuing on the bird theme, it's looking like [white-throated sparrows are in the process of
changing their song][14]! I didn't know that this happens, but thinking about it it seems like it must!
I found thinking about this interesting as a jumping off point to start thinking about the evolution of various aspects of bird song:
Does the species tend to have the same song? What makes a song a song? How does it change?
How often does it change? And many more questions!

If you know me, you know that [visualizing things in my head is really hard][12], but in this
collaboration between Adam Savage of the old MythBusters and Matt Parker of the YouTube
channel Numberphile [they build a rhombic dodecahedron and talk about infinity
mirrors][11]. Seeing it built is something that was suuupper helpful for me in thinking
about complex shapes.

Periodic Videos is a collaboration between the video journalist Brady Haran (who is
behind the YouTube channel Numberphile, if you are familiar with that) and some chemists at the University of Nottingham
(most notably Sir Martyn Poliakoff). In addition to current news in chemistry and
educational experiments, they also [produce a video exploring each element on the periodic table
of elements][10]. I've never been that interested in chemistry, but I found the endearing
and excited way that Sir Martyn Poliakoff talks about the aspects of each element to be really fun.

[Some thoughts on self-care during COVID-19][9] from CGP Grey.

[iNaturalist][8] is an app and data-hub where amatuer naturalists can learn about nature
through observation and participating in croudsourced identification. One can see and visit
others' observations near where you live, as well as take a picture of something you don't
know and have neighbors and experts help with the identification.

Cameras take pictures of light, which is just electromagnetic radiation, and WiFi is also
just electromagnetic radiation. With this framing, Justin Atkin with the Thought Emporium
creates a [camera that can see WiFi][7], and talks a bit about light in the process.

I don't know any art history, and I am generally not that interested in it, but [John Greene
talking about Young Farmers by August Sander][6] and treating the subjects in the painting as
people with histories and futures really captured me.

I've never really thought about how a toothbrush and toothpaste work... But apparently
toothpaste has fine minerals in it (there are various types depending on the brand) that give it
a texture similar to that of a 600-800 grit sandpaper. This rough texture scours away tartar, while
the less-rough-but-still-rough surface of the toothbrush bristles handle plaque. [Ben
Krasnow  explains all this while looking at a toothbrush and toothpaste under
various magnification][4].

One can float a screwdriver using compressed air! [Ben Krasnow of Applied Science
explains][5] how the shape of a common screwdriver creates a low pressure zone near its handle
when you pass air over it in a certain way. Through diffusion, this causes the screwdriver
to "hover" in midair.

[Why fish don't exist by Lulu Miller][3] is an extremely personal narrative of the
author's pursuit of meaning. I found it incredibly tender and vulnerable, and while reading it, I
was inspired to fight the fear of being vulnerable and the fear of thinking about the hard
questions that live with us. The content is definitely interesting, but I mostly came away
gracefully thankful for the author's sincerity.

On January 30, 2020 NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope was retired. The Spitzer took pictures
of deep space in the infrared spectrum, and paved the way for us to discover [the oldest
and farthest galaxy we've ever seen][1] (it's 32 billion light-years away and 13.4 billion
years old which is just 400 million years after the big bang!!). Upon retiring, [a picture
was compiled from more than 2 million snapshops taken over the last decade][2] showing a
super high resolution of the Milky Way (just 3% of our sky). If you view this image, a
good thing to keep in mind as you try to parse the sheer number of stars, is
that every dot of blue light you see is an entire solar system, and the red structures are
clouds of dust and gas that give birth to new ones. There are a lot of stars..
