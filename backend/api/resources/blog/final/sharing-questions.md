  realized that it's also important (if not just simply interesting) to share the
  questions you're asking even if you don't have answers yet. In light of that, here are
  some questions that I've been thinking about lately..."

I originally wanted to follow the
[blogs that I've read](https://www.camenpiho.com/recommendations?search=blog) and make
this a space where I would share my thoughts on questions that I've already sifted
through. But, I've come to think that unanswered questions are also worthy of being included in
public discourse (and are just interesting in and of themselves!). With that, here are
some questions that have been kicking around inside my head.

(side note: I have been working on an exploratory post on how trees get water from their
roots to their canopy for a couple weeks now, and its kicking my butt cause its hard! So
that's on the way, if you're interested!)

In no particular order:

1. What are the tools that I've used to make this site, and what do I think about them?
1. I've approximated the moonrise given a date and latitude-longitude coordinate for
   [RogueSky](https://www.camenpiho.com/rogue-sky), how did I do that?
1. Why has naming the nature around me enriched my life?
1. Over the last few years, I've slowly realized the places where anxiety dominates my
   thinking. What has that journey been like? Where am I at now? Where do I think I'm
   heading?
1. Why do I think the color blue in nature is so interesting?
1. What are some ideas that have become a part of my subconscious scenery, but are not
   things that I've always known?
1. What's cool about the moon?
1. The conscious recognition of emotions has been a large journey for me, what has that
   been like? Where am I at now? Where do I think I'm heading?
1. What is the evolutionary advantage for various aspects of tree design? For example, the
   different types of bark; needles versus leaves; a jagged leaf edge versus a smooth leaf
   edge.
1. What are some ways to do multiprocessing in Python?
1. When do clouds release their water as rain? Does it release only enough water to no
   longer be saturated or does it release all of it at once? What is the physics behind
   all this?
1. I'm currently unemployed and not completely sure what my future holds, how am I
   thinking about my future in this time? What are my goals and how am I trying to think
   about them?

If you would like to see a post on one of these before the others or would be interested in
