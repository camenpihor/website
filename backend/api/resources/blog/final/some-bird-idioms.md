Since I’ve started naming the birds I see, I’ve realized how present
they are in almost any jaunt outdoors. And then one evening while trying to be bird
punny, I realized how present bird idioms are in American English! Birds have gone from
annoying and dirty things I try to avoid (pigeons and seagulls), to realizing how
impactful they are on my visual, auditory, and cultural awareness.

Here’s a list of bird idioms that were common enough in my knowledge of American English that
my partner and I could think of them over the course of an evening.

_\*Some of these may have a different etymology, or are just wrong, but oh well! If you think
of any more, [let me know](mailto:camen.piho.r@gmail.com)!_

_\*\*I personally have been using "in full feather" more often to describe when I am receiving
more pride or joy from my appearance_
