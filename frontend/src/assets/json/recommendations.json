These headphones don't hurt at all, and are cheap enough that buying them for this singular purpose was 100% worthwhile. The 3 audiobook apps I have used (kindle, audible, and libby) all have a sleep timer, which also acts as a cool way to see how long it took to fall asleep. When having a light on is okay, I mostly just read a book, but at times when its not, I found this routine incredibly useful, and these earbuds are great for that.",
